            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) sits at the intersection of technical innovation and societal transformation, a
                duality I explored through this module’s blend of hands-on projects and ethical discourse. Grounded in
                Rolfe et al.’s (2001) reflective model, this e-portfolio synthesizes my journey from executing basic
                regression to critiquing neural networks, while navigating team collaboration and ethical dilemmas. The
                two anchor projects Airbnb NYC pricing analysis (classical ML) and CIFAR-10 object recognition (feature
                engineering), revealed gaps between textbook theory and real-world complexity, reshaping my approach to
                model design and evaluation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Technical Mastery</h2>
            <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering</h3>
            <p>The Airbnb project underscored EDA’s role in diagnosing data quality. By removing outliers (prices ≥
                $1,000, minimum_nights > 30) and imputing missing reviews_per_month with 0, I addressed skewness (Wang,
                2024). Visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, histograms) exposed weak linear correlations between price and
                features like availability_365 (r = 0.04), challenging my initial assumption that pricing was driven by
                singular factors.</p>

                <p>Figure B1: Airbnb NYC Price Distribution</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Advanced Architectures: ANN & CNN</h3>
            <p>Though I lacked resources to implement CNNs, theoretical study revealed their superiority in spatial
                hierarchies (e.g., image textures). The CIFAR-10 accuracy disparity (SVM: 49.2% vs. CNN: 95%)
                underscored the need for automated feature learning—a core tenet of deep learning (LeCun et al., 2015).
                <br>
                Ethical Trade-off: While CNNs excel in accuracy, their "black-box" nature conflicts with clinical/legal
                needs for explainability (Hutson, 2021). This tension will guide my future work on hybrid interpretable
                models.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Collaboration & Ethical Leadership</h2>
            <h3>Team Dynamics and Project Synergy</h3>
            <p>During the Airbnb NYC analysis project, I assumed a leadership role in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
                and unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering), while my peers focused on regression modeling and
                feature engineering. One of our key challenges was harmonizing divergent analytical
                strategies—particularly around data cleaning thresholds and the treatment of outliers. These
                disagreements, while initially slowing progress, eventually led to a more robust analytical pipeline.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations in Practice</h3>
            <p>Ethical data stewardship was embedded across all stages of the project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Privacy & Anonymization:</strong> Personal identifiers such as host_name and id were
                    excluded during preprocessing to ensure GDPR-aligned privacy protection, a critical consideration
                    given the use of real-world public datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Fairness & Equity Awareness:</strong> Our preliminary findings showed that
                    Airbnb listings in Manhattan had an average price 2.3 x higher than those in the Bronx. While this
                    reflected actual market trends, it also raised ethical concerns around exclusionary pricing dynamics
                    and the reinforcement of socioeconomic divides (Noble, 2018). I advocated for integrating
                    fairness-aware clustering techniques (e.g., demographic parity constraints) in future iterations to
                    address these biases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Leadership in Ethical Practice</h3>
            <p>Beyond technical execution, I authored a draft “Team Charter on Ethical Practice” to guide our work. This
                included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Commitments to transparency about model limitations and interpretability,</li>
                <li>Inclusive communication protocols during team reviews,</li>
                <li>A review checklist addressing bias, data leakage, and reproducibility.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This code of conduct was adopted informally by our cohort and later shared with other groups as a
                baseline template for responsible collaboration in data science coursework.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Critical Reflection</h2>
            <h3>Technical Mastery and Experiential Learning</h3>
            <p>This module marked a pivotal stage in the maturation of my machine learning capabilities, culminating in
                two cornerstone projects that shaped my understanding of applied AI: the Airbnb NYC 2019 pricing model
                and the CIFAR-10 object recognition task. <br>
                From a technical standpoint, I became proficient in Scikit-learn, particularly in applying Support
                Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) within structured pipelines. I also delved deeply
                into feature extraction, where I engineered hybrid vectors combining color histograms and Histogram of
                Oriented Gradients (HOG) to reduce CIFAR-10’s dimensionality. In parallel, I explored unsupervised
                learning through K-Means clustering, evaluating segmentation quality using silhouette scores and visual
                validation techniques. <br>
                As summarized in Table C2, engineered features yielded 372-dimensional vectors—compact yet expressive
                enough for traditional classifiers. <br>
                The Airbnb project allowed me to apply ML in a socio-economic context. We used linear regression to
                explore pricing predictors and clustering to segment hosts based on behavioral features like
                availability, engagement, and geographic location. Conversely, the CIFAR-10 assignment emphasized the
                limitations of classical ML in handling high-dimensional image data, prompting critical comparisons with
                deep learning architectures. <br>
                These dual experiences not only consolidated my practical skills, but also forced me to confront the
                boundaries of interpretability, model generalizability, and the ethical responsibilities of deploying ML
                in real-world environments.
            </p>

            <h3>Emotional, Cognitive, and Ethical Evolution</h3>
            <p>Initially, I encountered a great deal of frustration with the rigidity and underperformance of linear
                regression. Despite careful data cleaning and feature encoding, the R² score hovered below 0.30,
                illuminating the limitations of assuming linearity in a multifactorial system like Airbnb pricing. Yet,
                this frustration soon morphed into intellectual curiosity: Why was clustering more meaningful in this
                context than regression? <br>
                The switch to unsupervised learning unlocked insights that regression could not. Clustering revealed
                hidden behavioral segments—high-engagement vs low-engagement hosts—which were invisible to any single
                regression coefficient. The emotional arc of this realization, from dissatisfaction to discovery,
                underscored how exploratory ML methods can surface patterns that statistical rigor alone may overlook.
            </p>

            <h3>Theory in Practice: Bias and Oppression in ML</h3>
            <p>This module encouraged me to integrate critical theory into technical evaluation. Our Airbnb data, though
                numeric, revealed latent socio-economic inequalities. Listings in Manhattan were priced on average 2.3 ×
                higher than those in the Bronx, even after controlling for room type. This disproportionate valuation
                mirrored patterns described by Noble (2018) in Algorithms of Oppression, where algorithmic design—left
                unchecked—can amplify systemic disparities. <br>
                Though our model technically “worked,” it risked replicating exclusionary pricing patterns. This led me
                to propose future work using fairness-aware clustering algorithms, such as demographic parity
                constraints or adversarial de-biasing techniques. Here, machine learning is not just a computational
                tool—it is a mirror held up to society, and our role as practitioners is one of stewardship, not just
                design.
            </p>

            <h3>Growth in Leadership and Collaboration</h3>
            <p>Perhaps most profound was my development in collaborative leadership. As a student among equals with no
                formal authority, I learned how to lead through influence rather than instruction. During disagreements
                over outlier treatment and feature selection, I encouraged the use of A/B testing and model comparison
                metrics (e.g., silhouette coefficient) to resolve conflicts objectively. This not only improved our
                model quality but also fostered team cohesion. <br>
                The practice of reviewing GitHub commit logs, setting up peer reviews, and maintaining a transparent
                issue-tracking system gave me new appreciation for the discipline of reproducibility in data
                science—something often overlooked in academic projects but critical in industry and research.
            </p>

            <h3>Translating Learning into Real-World Impact</h3>
            <p>Inspired by the Airbnb project, I now aim to adapt our clustering methodology to healthcare, specifically
                in segmenting diabetic patients at [Hospital Name Redacted]. By analyzing variables like HbA1c variance,
                lifestyle behavior logs, and demographic factors, I believe we can develop behavioral subtypes of
                diabetic patients—those who are more responsive to diet changes, medication, or counseling. The goal is
                to reduce diagnostic time by 20% by 2026, aligning with NHS digital transformation objectives. <br>
                From the CIFAR-10 work, I became fascinated by the boundary between interpretable classical methods and
                high-performing deep learning models. While CNNs achieve superior accuracy, classical methods like
                HOG+SVM retain a level of transparency ideal for clinical contexts. My next step is to submit a research
                paper to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence titled: <br>
                <b>“Hybrid HOG-CNN Architectures for Interpretable Medical Image Classification”,</b> <br>
                where I argue for combining engineered features with deep feature extraction to improve explainability
                in critical settings such as radiology or histopathology.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This e-portfolio serves not only as a record of technical proficiency across machine learning
                fundamentals, but also as a reflection of my transformation as a researcher and ethical practitioner.
                Through the dual lenses of the Airbnb NYC and CIFAR-10 projects, I engaged with a wide spectrum of
                machine learning methodologies from exploratory data analysis and regression modeling to clustering,
                classical image classification, and reflective evaluation of algorithmic bias. <br>
                The process demanded more than technical skill. It required empathy, collaboration, self-awareness, and
                intellectual humility. I moved beyond viewing models as static tools, coming to see them as socially
                embedded systems whose design and outcomes shape human experiences in profound ways. I developed a more
                critical eye for fairness, interpretability, and the limits of performance-driven thinking, particularly
                when working with real-world data that reflects human inequalities. <br>
                Furthermore, I cultivated skills in leadership without authority, peer coordination, and ethical
                advocacy attributes increasingly vital in research environments and professional AI contexts. This
                growth has informed my future direction: translating machine learning from academic prototype to
                clinical utility, with a focus on equitable, interpretable, and human-centered AI. <br>
                This portfolio is therefore not just an endpoint, but a launchpad. The algorithms and models I’ve
                learned are tools, but the values and questions I’ve embraced around bias, collaboration, and
                responsibility, are what will shape the kind of researcher and practitioner I strive to be.
